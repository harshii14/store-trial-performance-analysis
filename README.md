Quantium Virtual Internship Task 2: Evaluation of store trials using control store comparisons and sales analytics.
# Quantium Virtual Internship - Task 2: Store Trial Analysis

## 📌 Overview
In this task, I analyzed the performance of a trial store (Store 77, 86, 88) to evaluate the impact of a trial campaign on chip sales. The trial stores were compared against control stores using metrics like:

- Total Sales
- Number of Customers
- Average Transactions per Customer

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Google Colab
- Excel (for visualization)
- PowerPoint (for final report)

## 📊 Key Insights
- Trial store 77 showed a significant increase in total sales post-trial compared to control.
- No uplift observed for stores 86 and 88 — potential external factors influenced behavior.
